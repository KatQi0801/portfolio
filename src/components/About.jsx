          <p>
            Hello all! I am Katjana Gora, a Computer Science graduate with a passion for
            software development, data visualization, and problem-solving. 
            I have experience in full-stack development from my internship at MITRE,
            where I worked with C#, .NET, React, and Agile methodologies to create
            user-focused solutions. Currently, I'm working in a caf√© while building
            my technical skills and exploring new opportunities in software development.
            Excited to see where new opportunities will take me!
